**Project Overview**
**Purpose:**
Kamazon is a Hackathon project inspired by Amazon, aiming to replicate its core functionalities. Users can browse products, add items to their cart, remove items, proceed to checkout, and make purchases using Stripe for payment processing. The project's goal is to provide a simplified shopping experience similar to Amazon's renowned platform.

**STAR Interview Questions**
**Situation:**
Kamazon was developed during a Hackathon as an emulation of Amazon's e-commerce platform. The idea arose from a desire to recreate essential shopping features in a short timeframe, focusing on cart management, checkout processes, and secure payment handling through Stripe.

**Task:**
The initial task involved designing and implementing essential features such as product listing, cart management, and checkout functionalities. Integration with Stripe for payment processing was crucial to replicate Amazon's seamless payment experience. Firebase was utilized for backend operations, including user authentication and real-time data management.

**Action:**
Kamazon was developed under a personal GitHub repository, utilizing agile practices to manage tasks efficiently during the Hackathon. A clear separation of frontend (client) and backend (server) functionalities was maintained for streamlined development and deployment. The repository contains dedicated folders for frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) codebases.

**Result:**
Following the Hackathon, Kamazon successfully emulates key functionalities of Amazon's shopping experience. Users can interact with a responsive frontend, add items to a cart, proceed through a checkout process integrated with Stripe for payments, and securely log in and out of their accounts. Firebase ensured robust backend operations, including secure user authentication and real-time data synchronization for a seamless user experience.
